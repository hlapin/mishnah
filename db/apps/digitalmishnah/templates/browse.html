                <p>Files are stored as XML, following the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative)
                    specifications. They are presented in converted into HTML using XSLT on the fly,
                    using a Cocoon pipeline. Most sigla for manuscript witnesses are based on the <i>Thesaurus of Talmud
                        Manuscripts</i>, ed. Sussmann et al. (Jerusalem: Yad Izhak ben Zvi and Friedenberg
                    Genizah Project, 2012), preceded by "S". Print editions are given a serial number of the same type, preceded by "P".</p>
                <p>In future versions, these sigla will be enriched to indicate type of manuscript
                    (e.g., Mishnah alone or with commentary; Talmud text) and other information.</p>
                <p>Sigla of the type "Kauf" are legacy files, that are part of the initial demo
                    based on Chapter 2 of Bava Metsi'a.</p>
                <p>Genizah fragments are encoded whole. Other witness files, except legacy files,
                    encode the text of Bava Qamma, Bava Metsi'a, and Bava Batra. Legacy files
                    include only Chapter 2 of Bava Metsi'a, and are gradually being replaced.</p>
                <p>The heading "J.G.M." refers to joined Genizah fragments as identified in the Sussmann Catalog. At a later stage, the project will provide virtual joins of such fragments. It will also extend joining to other manuscripts (e.g., the Maimonides autograph ms).</p>
